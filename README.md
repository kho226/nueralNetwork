# nueralNetwork
## A nueral network built with the purpose of recognizing handwritten letters.
###### An example initialization of the nueralNetwork...
- inputNodes = 3
- hiddenLayerNodes = 3
- outputNodes = 3
- learningFactor = 0.1
- nueralNetwork = nueralNetwork(inputNodes, hiddenLayerNodes, outputNodes, learningFactor)
